# Titanic Survival Prediction

End-to-end machine learning project predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** models.

---

## Goal
Predict whether a passenger survived based on features such as **Age**, **Sex**, **Fare**, and **Class**.

Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Model Results

| Model | Accuracy | F1 | ROC-AUC |
|-------|-----------|----|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.80 | 0.73 | 0.84 |
| Decision Tree | 0.76 | 0.70 | 0.79 |
| Random Forest | **0.79** | **0.73** | **0.83** |

> The **Random Forest** achieved the best overall performance and generalization.

---

## Key Insights
- The most important predictors were **Sex**, **Fare**, and **Age**.  
- Tree-based models captured nonlinear relationships better than Logistic Regression.  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest) reduced variance and improved stability.
